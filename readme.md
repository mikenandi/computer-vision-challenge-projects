# üß† 28-Day Computer Vision with TensorFlow ‚Äì Project Roadmap

This repo documents my **28-day deep dive into Computer Vision using TensorFlow**.  
The goal is to strengthen my **understanding of CV fundamentals, transfer learning, real-time detection, and medical/agriculture applications**, while also experimenting with advanced techniques like segmentation, embeddings, and pose estimation.

---

## üîÑ Pivot Note

Originally, this challenge started with **PyTorch + Jupyter Notebooks**.  
From **04-October-2025 onward, I‚Äôm pivoting to use:**

- **TensorFlow/Keras** instead of PyTorch
- **Google Colab** instead of Jupyter Notebook

This shift is to better align with production workflows, TPU acceleration, and TensorFlow‚Äôs ecosystem.

---

## üìå Challenge Rules

- üîπ 1 project per day ‚Üí **28 projects in 28 days**
- üîπ Only **TensorFlow/Keras** for modeling
- üîπ Use **publicly available datasets** (linked below)
- üîπ Cover a wide range of tasks ‚Üí classification, detection, segmentation, pose estimation, image retrieval, etc.
- üîπ Deliverables per project: **Google Colab Notebook + README + results (curves, confusion matrix, predictions)**
